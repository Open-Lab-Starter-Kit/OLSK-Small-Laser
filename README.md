Introduction
--

The OLSK Small Laser V2 is a compact but powerful desktop laser cutter. It features the design of the **[Fabulaser Mini](https://github.com/fab-machines/Fabulaser-Mini)**, developed to fit in Fab Labs and classrooms. It aims to lower the boundaries of accessing laser-cutting technology, representing an ideal compromise between performance and cost. With an optimized 40W CO2 laser, it can cut 8mm acrylic, and with a cutting area of 600x400mm is one the largest of this machine category. The compact machine size of 1161 x 812 x 390 mm allows usage in small rooms with a normal table or a desk.

A tool to make, a tool to learn.

In comparison to commercial laser cutters, OLSK Small Laser adds on top of the laser cutting functionalities a valuable learning experience. Ideally built together with students during a workshop, OLSK Small Laser will give the user not only the possibility to laser cut but also to learn how the machine is made, and how it works. The final user will not only be learning about electronics, mechanics and lasers, but will also have a deep knowledge of the machine, so to be able to efficiently execute maintenance, apply improvements and even design his own machine later on!

The Assembly Manual

OLSK Small Laser comes with a state of art building instruction manual, detailing any of the many building details. Divided in logical steps, the manual also instructs on general building practices, laser calibration and how to connect all the electronics of the machine. Teachers and lecturers can also use the manual to divide workshop participants into building groups.
